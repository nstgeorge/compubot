# [voice.py](mdc:src/commands/voice.py)

- `voice_state` contains our `ActiveVoiceState`, which includes many useful tools
- `voice_state.ws` is called VoiceGateway, which is usually how we'll interact with the Discord voice socket
- Although Discord documentation calls it the `secret_key`, it is attached as `voice_state.ws.secret`
